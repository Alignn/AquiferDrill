Adds an Aquifer Drill, which uses fuel to draw up water anywhere. Requires no research. One drill is about enough for one steam engine; I recommend leaving the engines disconnected until the pipe system is filled up to avoid rapid fluctuations.

To download & install: Use the in-game mod browser and look for "Drill to Aquifer"  
To download manually: Check the [releases tab](https://github.com/Alignn/AquiferDrill/releases).  
Download AquiferDrill_1.2.1.zip from there.  
To install manually: Put the .zip file in this folder: C:\Users\your name here\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods, unless of course your mod folder is somewhere else.

Unzipping is not necessary.
